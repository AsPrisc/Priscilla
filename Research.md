A conventional metaphor states 'The eyes are the window of the soul' 
This is not enough - The eyes are the window of the cognition, as well.

Eyes and cognition are the skeleton of my Doctorate (PhD) Studies.
I am a second-year PhD student at the Vision Lab Essex based at the Department of Psychology in the University of Essex, UK.  I am under the supervision of Tom Foulsham and Kevin Dent.

# My Research:

Have you ever wondered what might  happened if we are not able to attend to the red lights while walking, cycling or driving? 
It would be chaotic. Wouldn't it be? 

Previous research has suggested that within a scene a great amount of perceptual information facilitates distractors avoidance, conversely; a great amount of cognitive information impedes distractor avoidance (see, Lavie, 2005).  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterises by the difficulty to avoid distractions (ADHD; APA, 2013).

My PhD project is aimed at investigating: how our attention is captured while perceptual information (image scenes) and cognitive information (the performance of a cognitive task) interplay. Furthermore, whether a subclinical population with ADHD-like traits perform differently. To do this, I am currently testing a large sample of participants with high and low traits of ADHD while performing cognitive task. Specifically, these are paradigms (task) to measure working memory load, cognitive control, and reinforcement learning. 


# Current Work:

Apart from my research, I am collaborating with 
- Jessica Dawson. We are studying whether occluding the eyes with sunglasses affects the way we observe group conversation and whether ADHD-like traits affects this.

- Loes Van Dam and Jack Mitchell. We are studying Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder in VR (Virtual Reality) environment.
