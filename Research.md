My name: Astrid Priscilla Martinez-Cedillo. I am a PhD researcher at the Vision Lab in Essex based at the Department of Psychology, University of Essex, UK.  

Hobbies: Playing around with some data and trying to make my codes run. I love to dance, cycle, walk, read and dance again. As of March 2019, I started in the yoga world - I am quite excited, and relaxed.
I am learning/using: (1) R studio, (2) MATLAB, (3) HTML and Java for running online experiments, (4) Unity & Blender with Body Creator, simply curiosity.

# My Research:

My PhD project investigates how our visual attention is captured during the performance of cognitive and image-viewing tasks. These tasks are designed to measure the effects of high and low loads of working memory on what we look at in images. Performance can tell us about mental distraction and the link with visual attention â€“ just as we might find our eyes drifting away from an important work document if we are thinking about something else. I am also investigating how traits of inattention and distractibility affect task performance. To achieve this, I am currently testing a sample based on a sub-clinical population with high and low traits of ADHD and Mind-Wandering. This includes studying how individuals differ when watching realistic conversations (and whether hiding social cues with sunglasses make a difference).  


# Current Work:

Apart from my research, I am collaborating with 

- Jessica Dawson. We are studying whether occluding the eyes with sunglasses affects the way we observe group conversation and whether ADHD-like traits affects this.

- Jack Mitchell. We are investigating the bodily knowledge and perception within the general population and body builders. 

- MD. Lilia Albores-Gallo & MD Patricia Zabaleta. we are studying cognitive impairments in ADHD, ASD and ADHD +ASD.
