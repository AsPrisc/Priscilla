A conventional metaphor states 'The eyes are the window of the soul' 
This is not enough - The eyes are the window of the cognition, as well.

Eyes and cognition are the skeleton of my Doctorate (PhD) Studies.
I am under the supervision of Tom Foulsham and Kevin Dent.

# My Research:

Have you ever wondered what might  happened if we are not able to attend to the red lights while walking, cycling or driving? 
It would be chaotic. Wouldn't it be? 

Previous research has suggested that within a scene a great amount of perceptual information facilitates distractors avoidance, conversely; a great amount of cognitive information impedes distractor avoidance (see, Lavie, 2005).  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterises by the difficulty to avoid distractions (ADHD; APA, 2013).

In my research I am trying to understand: how our attention is captured while perceptual information (image scenes) and cognitive information (cognitive task) interplay. Furthermore, whether a subclinical population with ADHD-like traits perform differently. 


# Current Work:

Apart from my research, I am collaborating with Jessica Dawson. We are studying whether occluding the eyes with sunglasses affects the way we observe group conversation and whether ADHD-like traits affects this.
