A conventional metaphor states 'The eyes are the window of the soul' 
This is not enough - The eyes are the window of the cognition, as well.

Eyes and cognition are the skeleton of my Doctorate (PhD) Studies.
My name: Astrid Priscilla Martinez-Cedillo. I am a third year PhD student at the Vision Lab in Essex based at the Department of Psychology in the University of Essex, UK.  I am under the supervision of Tom Foulsham and Kevin Dent.

Hobbies: Playing around with some data and trying to make my codes run. :)  I love to dance, cycle, walk, read and dance again. As of March 2019, I started in the yoga world :) - I am quite excited, and relaxed.

Qualifications: Bachelor in Science (Clinical Psychology) UMA Mexico (2012) Certified as Clinical Neuropsychology, BUAP (2011) Master in Science (Research Master in Cognitive Neuropsychology) VU Amsterdam (2015) Associate Fellowship Higher Education Academy (AFHEA).

I am learning/using: (1) R studio for data analysis and visualisation, (2) MATLAB for creating stimuli (PsychToolbox and Saliency Toolbox), and (3) Unity & Blender with Body Creator, simply curiosity.

Member: (1) Vision Lab Essex (2) Colchester R Group (3) POWER Providing Opportunities for Women in Education Research (4) Essex Open Science Working Group (5) Sociedad Mexicana de Psicologia (6) Vision Science Society. 

# My Research:

Have you ever wondered what might happened if we are not able to attend to the red lights while walking, cycling or driving? 
It would be chaotic. Wouldn't it be? 

Previous research has suggested that high loads of cognitive information impedes distractor avoidance (see, Lavie, 2005).The difficulty to avoid distractors is commonly observed in people diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; APA, 2013). My PhD project is aimed at investigating: how our attention is captured during the performance of cognitive and image-viewing tasks. Furthermore, whether a subclinical population with ADHD-like traits perform differently. To do this, I am currently testing a large sample of participants with high and low traits of ADHD while performing cognitive task. Specifically, these are paradigms to measure working memory load, cognitive control, and reinforcement learning. 

# Current Work:

Apart from my research, I am collaborating with 

- Jessica Dawson. We are studying whether occluding the eyes with sunglasses affects the way we observe group conversation and whether ADHD-like traits affects this.

- Dr. Lilia Albores-Gallo. we are studying cognitive impairments in ADHD, ASD and ADHD +ASD.
