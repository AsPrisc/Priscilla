A conventional metaphor states 'The eyes are the window of the soul' This is not enough - 
# The eyes are the window of the cognition, as well.
Eyes and cognition are the skeleton of my Doctorate (PhD) Studies.

I am under the supervision of Tom Foulsham and Kevin Dent.

# My Research:

On a daily basis, avoiding distractors are crucial for our quality of life. Without this ability, it would be difficult to attend to the red lights when cycling, driving or walking. It has been suggested that perceptual information helps to avoid visual distractors, however; loads of cognitive information interfere on distractor avoidance (see Lavie 2005). One of the main symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the difficulty to avoid distractors (ADHD; APA, 2013).
In my research I am trying to understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms while looking at perceptual information (image scenes). More specifically, why we tend to look at certain areas (a person) and other areas seems to be less relevant during several cognitive task. Furthermore, why people with high traits of ADHD seem to have difficulties to inhibit certain areas of an image.

# Current Work:

Apart from my research, I am collaborating with Jessica Dawson. We are studying whether occluding the eyes with sunglasses affects the way we observe group conversation and whether ADHD-like traits affects this.
