There are many ways to analyse eye tracking data. 

Scan Path are useful to understand the trajectory of the eye movements, you can find an example of the Scan Paths in this video.

Heat Map are another useful way to visualise the data. There are two examples of heat maps in this videos. 
Participants were asked simply to look at the image while performing a cognitive task.

#Apparatus 
The experiment was programmed in Matlab (version 9.1.0, R2016b; the Mathworks, Natick, MA), using the Psychophysics Toolbox. 
Eyes positions were recorded using SMI Eye link system, which consists of a head-mounted camera that samples pupil location at 250 Hz.
