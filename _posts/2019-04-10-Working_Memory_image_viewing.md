This stimuli was designed to test where do people look at and the time they spend to look at different features within an image. We have selected areas of interest (1) a person, (2) an object (high salient), (3) a background). 


#Apparatus 
The experiment was programmed in Matlab (version 9.1.0, R2016b; the Mathworks, Natick, MA), using the Psychophysics Toolbox. 
Eyes positions were recorded using SMI Eye link system, which consists of a head-mounted camera that samples pupil location at 250 Hz.
