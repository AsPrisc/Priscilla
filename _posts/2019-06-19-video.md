There are many ways to analyse/visualise eye tracking data. 

# Participants were asked simply to look at the image while performing a cognitive task. 

Scan Paths are useful to understand the trajectory of the eye movements, you can find examples of the Scan Paths in these video.

Heat Maps are another useful way to visualise the data. There are two examples of heat maps in these videos.

# Apparatus 
The experiment was programmed in Matlab (version 9.1.0, R2016b; the Mathworks, Natick, MA), using the Psychophysics Toolbox. 
Eyes positions were recorded using SMI Eye link system, which consists of a head-mounted camera that samples pupil location at 250 Hz.
